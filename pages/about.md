## About the Collection

As the host of one of the largest collections of Milton material in North America, Western University has access to a wide range of materials, especially concerning Paradise Lost, Milton's great epic poem. This site hosts a selection of illustrations of Eve, one of the epic's main characters, depicting different scenes from the poem. By displaying these works by external illustrators, we can exploring how Eve, as imagined by Milton, has been interpreted by others.

The images consist of 6 illustrations, spanning Eve's first appearance in Eden to her shaming and expulsion from paradise with Adam, ranging from Books IV-X.
